### Hello guys

Currently not much here but this is a back up of my current neovim setup. I also
have an old vimrc file in here which was a much more barebone config compared to
my current nvim setup. I am pretty pleased how it looks and feels like. It is a
much nicer experience with most of the UI elements away from the screen and not
having to use the mouse is the best feature of vim.

**What this neovim config can do**
- [X] auto complete (CMP)
- [X] snippets (luasnip)
- [X] indent lines (indent blankline)
- [X] treesitter
- [X] syntax highlighting (tokyonight)
- [X] lualine
- [X] autopairs
- [X] telescope
- [X] floating terminal
- [X] markdown preview
- [X] LSP
    - [X] html
    - [X] css
    - [X] typescript
    - [X] rust
    - [X] python
    - [X] lua

PS: I've been fiddling around a lot because of some bugs in plugins to find
workarounds. Some of the files are super messy because of that like the `autocmd.lua` file
and others. Everything works flawlessly for the most part. You can find some of
the TODO, BUG or WARNING comments through grep with telescope `CTRL+t` . It's super useful to get
back on things after a long weekend.
