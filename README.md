### Hello guys

Currently not much here but this is a back up of my current neovim setup. I also
have an old vimrc file in here which was a much more barebone config compared to
my current nvim setup. I am pretty pleased how it looks and feels like. It is a
much nicer experience with most of the UI elements away from the screen and not
having to use the mouse is actually a the best feature of vim.
